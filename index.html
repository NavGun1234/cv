                    <p>
                        I am a student at St. Roch. I have gotten into their Drama program and is being really successful.
                        I am taking Angela Yu's Python Coding course so I can become a software developer / web developer /
                        game developer! I took advantage of Covid to learn this new skill. So far, I have made many projects, like
                        a calculator, a quiz game, a timer, even created my own flight club. I really hope to become someone
                        successful from taking this course!
